//! The XrdSsiStream class describes an object capable of providing data for a
//! response in real time. A pointer to such an object may be used to set this
//! response mode via XrdSsiResponder::SetResponse(). Two kinds of streams exist:
//! Active  the stream supplies the buffer that contains the response data.
//!         The buffer is recycled via Buffer::Recycle() once the response data
//!         is sent. Active streams are supported only server-side.
//! Passive the stream requires a buffer to be passed to it where response data
//!         will be placed. Only passive streams are created on the client-side.
//!         Passive streams can also work in asynchronous mode. However, async
//!         mode is never used server-side but may be requested client-side.
//!
//! The type of stream must be declared at the time the stream is created. You
//! must supply an implementation for the associated stream type.
