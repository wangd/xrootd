//! already provided for client-side use.

//!              assumes ownership of the request object until the request is
//!              completed or canceled.
//!
//! Server-side: ProcessRequest() is called when a new request is received.
//!              It is always called using a new thread.
//!
//! @param  reqP   pointer to the object describing the request. This object
//!                is also used to effect a response. Ownwership of the
